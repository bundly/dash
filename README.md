## Inspiration
As MLH Fellows, we use a lot of applications in our daily life, such as:
- Contributing to the projects using GitHub

  - Staying in touch with PRs you participated in and across your projects
  - Sharing your daily notes before standup
- Keeping in sync with the Google Calendar for current events
- Monitoring the super active Discord channels so that you don't miss out on any important messages
- and much more!

Wouldn't it be nice, if there was a platform where all these things mentioned above could be found and modified according to your preferences, all at one place? We present to you, **Bundly** üéâ
